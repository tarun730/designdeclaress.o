## 📢 About

Design Declares is part of a global movement of designers and design agencies committed to taking climate action. We acknowledge that the design industry has a role in contributing to the climate and ecological crisis — and that we have the tools, creativity, and responsibility to help solve it.

This repository serves as an open resource hub and collaborative space for those who want to align their design practices with sustainability and justice.
